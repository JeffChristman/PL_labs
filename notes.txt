Most systems aren't designed to transfer large amounts of data from another source in one go. 
As a result, most systems fragment data in transit. The recipient reassembles it based on rules 
written into the software.

Networks set maximum transmission units (MTUs) that specify how much data they can process at once. 
Most networks use a 1,500-byte limit. Send something bigger, and it will be:

Fragmented. The originating device or its associated routers break the piece into fragment datagrams.

Sent. All of the pieces head to the destination with headers that describe the order for reassembly.

Reassembled. The destination server waits for all the fragments to arrive. When they're in place, 
the system puts the message back together and delivers it.

Some older operating systems contain a bug. They grow confused during the reassembly phase, 
especially when the data packets seem to overlap by a byte or two.

When the system is confused, it pauses, thinks, and then crashes. A crashed server can't deliver resources, 
and your customers and employees can't do their crucial work.
